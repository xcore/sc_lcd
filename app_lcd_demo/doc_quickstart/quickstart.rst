sc_lcd demo : quick start guide
-------------------------------

This simple demonstration of xTIMEcomposer Studio functionality uses the XA-SK-SCR480 Slice Card together with the xSOFTip ``module_lcd`` to demonstrate how the module is used to write to an LCD screen.

Hardware setup
++++++++++++++

The XP-SKC-L2 sliceKIT Core board has four slots with edge connectors: ``SQUARE``, ``CIRCLE``, ``TRIANGLE`` and ``STAR``. 

To setup up the system:

   #. Connect XA-SK-SCR480 Slice Card to the XP-SKC-L2 sliceKIT Core board using the connector marked with the ``STAR``.
   #. Connect the XTAG Adapter to sliceKIT Core board, and connect XTAG-2 to the Adapter. 
   #. Connect the XTAG-2 to host PC. Note that the USB cable is not provided with the sliceKIT starter kit.
   #. Set the ``XMOS LINK`` to ``OFF`` on the XTAG Adapter.
   #. Ensure the jumper on the XA-SK-SCR480 is bridged if the back light is required.
   #. Switch on the power supply to the sliceKIT Core board.

   Hardware Setup for LCD Demo
   
	
Import and build the application
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

   #. Open xTIMEcomposer and check that it is operating in online mode. Open the edit perspective (Window->Open Perspective->XMOS Edit).
   #. Locate the ``'sliceKIT LCD Demo'`` item in the xSOFTip pane on the bottom left of the window and drag it into the Project Explorer window in the xTIMEcomposer. This will also cause the modules on which this application depends (in this case, module_lcd) to be imported as well. 
   #. Click on the app_lcd_demo item in the Project Explorer pane then click on the build icon (hammer) in xTIMEcomposer. Check the console window to verify that the application has built successfully.

For help in using xTIMEcomposer, try the xTIMEcomposer tutorial, which you can find by selecting Help->Tutorials from the xTIMEcomposer menu.

Note that the Developer Column in the xTIMEcomposer on the right hand side of your screen provides information on the xSOFTip components you are using. Select the module_lcd component in the Project Explorer, and you will see its description together with API documentation. Having done this, click the `back` icon until you return to this quickstart guide within the Developer Column.

Run the application
+++++++++++++++++++

Now that the application has been compiled, the next step is to run it on the sliceKIT Core Board using the tools to load the application over JTAG (via the XTAG2 and Xtag Adapter card) into the xCORE multicore microcontroller.

   #. Select the file ``app_lcd_demo.xc`` in the ``app_lcd_demo`` project from the Project Explorer.
   #. Click on the ``Run`` icon (the white arrow in the green circle). 
   #. At the ``Select Device`` dialog select ``XMOS XTAG-2 connect to L1[0..1]`` and click ``OK``.
   #. The output on the LCD should look like a bouncing "X".
    
Next steps
++++++++++

  #. Examine the application code. In xTIMEcomposer navigate to the ``src`` directory under app_lcd_demo and double click on the ``app_lcd_demo.xc`` file within it. The file will open in the central editor window.
  #. Trying changing the ``int x=20, y=0, vx=1, vy=2;`` variables on line 23, they represent: initial x coord, initial y coord, x velocity and y velocity respectively.
  #. In the ``sub()`` function what would you expect to see if the line: ``buffer[i] = BACK_COLOUR;`` was changed to ``buffer[i] = 0x12345678;``?

Try the full display controller demo
....................................

This application is necessarily limited since there is no external memory available for a full framebuffer, and the internal memory of an XCore Tile is too small to buffer a full screen colour image. The Display Controller demo combines the functionality of this LCD module with the SDRAM Controller component and SDRAM Slice Card. Together they implement a fully functioning LCD Display Controller by adding the memory controller and a component that takes care of framebuffer management. 

Once you have both the XA-SK-SDRAM and XA-SK-SCR480 slices you can try the Display Controller demo by :ref:`Display_controller_demo_quickstart`

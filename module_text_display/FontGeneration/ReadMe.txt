The main.c is designed to generate the font tables as .c file
The generated files can be either memory optimized(by defining ROM_OPTIMIZED in the code) or not optimized for memort (by removing the define ROM_OPTIMIZED)
In order to generate the main.c, the following should be included
  - freetype 2 library for the include files
  - libfreetype.dll.a (available with Cygwin installation)

The main.exe can be generated by running the make command. (Should install GNUwin32 for the same or can be run directly on Linux platform). The "makefile" has been provided for the build settings.

To built the main.c, the following command should be typed in the "command prompt"
C:\GnuWin32\make.exe -f Makefile

This will generate the make.exe
main.exe needs the following arguments
Argument 1 - The font file (e.g. C:/Windows/Fonts/Arial.ttf)
Argument 2 - The font name (e.g. Arial_Normal)
Argument 3 - Width of the font
Argument 4 - Height of the font
Argument 5 - Name of the output file (should be a .c file. e.g.: Arial16x16.c)

The execute.bat can be configured for the required font tables. 
Executing the execute.bat will generate the required font table files. These font table files can be copied to the module_text_display.

Note: remove the folder FontGeneration from the module_text_display before building the project
